## Architecture
Started out as a traditional, multi page, html website bundled with parcel.  

Morphed into a site using web components. Changed to Vite bundler when parcel had problems with the 'keycloak.js' library.  

## Testing
Testing with Vitest and Testing Library DOM.

## Deployment
Deploying development and production docker images to Docker Hub.
